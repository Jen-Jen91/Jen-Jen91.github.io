# Portfolio Website

This single-page website was created in JavaScript, making use of the Strata site template (created by HTML5 UP) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

The portfolio site contains a description of my coding experience, my contact details, and a linked list of various development projects I've worked on.

- To run the site locally in development mode, you can open _index.html_.
- To view the deployed website, you can visit https://jen-jen91.github.io/
